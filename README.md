# ArcToArcDubins
This package finds the shortest dubins path between two arcs.
The start and end configurations are tangential to the first and second arcs

The example script "Example_DubA2A.py" provides the necessary syntax to call the functions.

The environment is defined in the file "dubinsPaths.yml". 
You can create an environment from this yml file, or one may install all the necessary packages imported in the headers of each file.
